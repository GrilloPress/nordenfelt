    <p>
      Initially the Working
Together programme will be constructed around
4 interdependent themes, Sharing and Adopting
Good Practice, Developing a Sustainable Service
Configuration, Assuring Sustainable Service Quality
and creating a cross Trust care environment through
the deployment of Informatics. The overall aim is to
improve and sustain the quality of our clinical services
whilst also providing them more efficiently and
effectively and to do so together.

      <p>The Spanish Peral Submarine was launched in 1888, and had 3 Schwarzkopf torpedoes 14 in (360 mm) and one torpedo tube in bow, 
      new air systems, hull shape, propeller, and cruciform external controls anticipating much later designs. 
      Peral was an all-electrical powered submarine.[11] After two years of trials the project was scrapped by naval officialdom who cited, 
      among other reasons, concerns over the range permitted by its batteries.</p>
