    <h1 class="centered"> Workstream Philosophy </h1>
      <p>Each Trust has worked hard to improve practice
through their own programmes but little of this has
been shared. Finding new and innovative ways to
improve efficiency has become more difficult but by
sharing and adopting these across the Trusts new
opportunities will be introduced. Currently there are
two projects where there opportunities are being
developed:</p>

<p><strong>Procurement</strong> - Seeking to standardise where
possible on products that can be bought more
effectively by a large and influential group of Trusts
which will introduce discounts not currently enjoyed.
These products initially will be those used generically
in clinical practice but not pharmaceuticals.</p>

<p><strong>Medical Locums</strong> - Understanding the causes of need
to recruit locums and to minimise this whilst seeking
more cost effective methods of procuring locums
when they are necessary. This may expand to other
professional locums in due course.</p>
