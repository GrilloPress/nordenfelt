Based on the excellent work of the Hackathon-Starter, this has been extended
to remove the third-party API use (some work left here to do) and migrate from Jade to Handlebars/HTML.

Once ready and sanitized, this boilerplate will be able to quickly set up a 
basic Express website with a home page, about page, contact form and a simple blog.

The idea is essentially a reusable and easy to configure starting place to quickly and efficiently build 
small sites and apps with JavaScript end to end.
